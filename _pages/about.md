I am a second year Masters student in Computer Science at [Stanford University](https://www.cs.stanford.edu) where I research multisensory learning, robotics, and computer vision advised by Professor [Jiajun Wu](https://jiajunwu.com/).

I graduated from Stanford University with a Bachelors in Computer Science (2025). In my undergraduate, I was very fortunate to be advised by Professor Jiajun Wu and Professor [Hyo Gweon](https://psychology.stanford.edu/people/hyowon-gweon), working on robotics and human cognition.
